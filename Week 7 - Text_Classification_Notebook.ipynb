The plant now dubiously boasts the poorest levels of productivity, quality and working conditions of any Ford factory in Europe. Unless it can effect a remarkable recovery, the factory may well disappear back into the bleak and sodden marshes of Essex from which it emerged nearly 60 years ago. The evidence of Dagenham's predicament can be gauged from internal company documents which illustrate graphically the task confronting Ford and its workforce. These show that it takes Dagenham nearly twice as long to produce a Sierra car as it does Ford's Genk plant in Belgium. The picture is similar when Fiesta production is compared at Dagenham and Valencia. The British plant takes 53 hours to turn out each car, the Spanish factory 30 hours. Product quality at the Essex factory is also inferior, measured against any index, whether it be ratings out of 10, defects per vehicle or warranty costs on each car leaving the factory gate. The Dagenham workforce would argue that there are good reasons why the ageing plant cannot match the performance of its modern Continental rivals. However, the documents also show that Dagenham's car body and assembly operations are failing to meet even its own internal targets. In 1988 the plant was scheduled to produce 992 cars a day.\"\n",

Ray Fletcher, the personnel manager at Rover's Swindon plant and Graham Spaull, the training manager, are concerned that to many youngsters engineering means long hours, tedious jobs and dirty hands.

Lavender, for instance, yields an essential oil from the flowers and leaves. The orange tree is particularly interesting for it produces three different-smelling essences with differing therapeutic properties: neroli (blossom), petit-grain (leaves) and orange (rind).

Then somehow we did get romantically linked up and some people, right near the end of the situation with that band, singled us out as potentially more interesting than the band, which I suppose was a cruel situation really.
